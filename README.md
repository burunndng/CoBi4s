# CogniBias: Architect Edition

**A high-fidelity cognitive debugging platform for real-world behavioral modification.**

CogniBias is a React 19 PWA designed to dismantle cognitive distortions and logical fallacies through adversarial pedagogy, real-time neural mirroring, and "In-the-Wild" transfer training.
